Immersions.art is a VR platform designed by artists for artists.

Our public beta is available now, please go to https://immersions.art and explore three immersive artworks. With your help, we would like to organise an inaugural virtual exhibition and release an open source library that every artist can use to create their own immersive experiences.

Immersions.art is based on WebXR, an open javascript standard that brings extended reality to the web. The so-called immersive web builds up on the qualities of the web: it is open, works on most browsers and is easy to share.

By funding our inaugural virtual exhibition and open call for participation, you not only support a one-off artistic project, you also allow us to continue our development and release our code in the form of an open source library.

Artists could use the library whether their immersive art is published on the immersions portal or not. They could host it on their own website as long as they  include a link to the portal.

Just a bit of javascript knowledge will be required, thanks in good part to WebXR and the babylon.js library: a library that makes it super simple to develop virtual experiences on the web. We will also provide a free-to-use sound library to complement a wide variety of immersive experiences.

A full list of candidate features is available on our Github issues page. All suggestions are welcomed!
